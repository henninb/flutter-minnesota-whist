**Last updated: October 25, 2025**

## Introduction

This privacy policy applies to the Minnesota Whist app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Brian Henning (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service.

## Information Collection and Use

The Application does not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information. The Application is a fully offline game that operates entirely on your device.

### Third-Party Services

The Application does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

### Data Collection

The Application does not collect any data whatsoever. All game functionality is local to your device.

## Data Storage

The Application stores game state and preferences locally on your device. This data includes:
- Game scores
- Player names (if entered)
- App settings and preferences

This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers operated by the Service Provider.

## Network Access

The Application does not require or use internet access. The app functions entirely offline.

## Children's Privacy

The Application does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. The Application is suitable for all ages.

## Data Retention

Since the Application does not collect personal data directly, there is no data retention policy. Local game data stored on your device can be deleted by uninstalling the Application.

## Security

The Service Provider is committed to ensuring the security of your information. The Application employs appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any data processed.

## Third-Party Links

The Application does not contain links to external websites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

The Service Provider may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

This privacy policy is effective as of October 25, 2025.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your data, including:
- The right to access data collected about you
- The right to request deletion of your data
- The right to opt-out of data collection

Since the Application does not directly collect or store personal data on external servers, most of these rights are inherently protected by the Application's design.
